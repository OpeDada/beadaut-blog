You can now add your private YouTube videos as contents on your course. If you prefer to upload your videos to YouTube, you can copy the video URL directly to the “YouTube Video URL” text box in the edit course view. Please note that you can only choose between uploading video directly to Beadaut or using the YouTube video link in each content page.
