Let’s Set The Record Straight About Money

Many people struggle to charge money for their skills and services and this is arguably the biggest reason why a lot of people are not making good money online.

If you struggle to put a price on your knowledge, skill or expertise. Or maybe you think it’s not right to charge money for what you do so easily. Guess what? That’s exactly why you should get paid for it because you do effortlessly what many people struggle with. When we talk about developing a course, you might be hesitant because you don’t feel comfortable ‘selling’ your knowledge or skill and so you put it off.

Why do you find it difficult or even feel guilty to ask for a fee for your efforts? The answer is found in one of these:

You have an unhealthy mindset about money and probably think it is wrong or evil to demand payment for your knowledge or skills. This belief could have been formed from your childhood, as a result of your upbringing, cultural or religious doctrines and practices without you realising it.

If this is the case with you, then you can change your mindset about money and pick up healthy new beliefs such as “money is just a tool, it is up to me how I use it” and “I can make money and still be moral person”.

Another reason you feel guilty about charging a fee for your skill might be because you lack confidence in your own abilities, skill or expertise. This lack of confidence could be from the fact that no one has ever appreciated your work enough to pay you for it. And so you don’t know your own worth.

If the problem is your lack of confidence, then you may want to boost your confidence by focusing on your strengths, working on your skill everyday or enrolling for a professional training and getting certified. Although you should know that certification does not automatically improve confidence, it ultimately comes down to your ability to deliver quality job.

Lastly, you probably are not charging enough for your services because you lack experience. If you’ve not done something long enough, it might be difficult to build authority in that thing. With practice comes mastery and mastery builds confidence and authority.

If you identified lack of experience as the cause of your struggle, then the solution is to simply get as much experience as you possibly can till you become comfortable with attaching a fee to what you do. The easiest way to start is probably by offering your services for free in exchange for honest reviews which will then be used to boost your expert status.

Now that you know why you struggle to properly charge for your services and what you can do to overcome your struggles let’s talk about the top reasons why you should earn from your knowledge, skills and expertise.

The number one reason why you should charge money for your skill and expertise is that it will enable you to build a business and get results for your clients faster. Ever heard of the saying ‘when people pay, they pay attention’? If you’re serious about building a business, then you need to focus on helping people get results fast. What better way to do that than asking for asking for a fee?

Another equally important reason is that you can focus your time and energy on meaningful activities while sifting those who are not serious about engaging your services for good.

Last but not least, earning money for your skills gives you a high chance of creating a lifestyle you are proud of.
