Last week I promised to share the types of contents you should be creating if you want massive engagement on your social media. Truth is creating valuable content consistently is demanding work and one of the things that makes it all worth it is when people respond well to the posts. The opposite is the reality for most people and that’s frustrating.

Without further ado, here we go:

Fill in the blank
Fill in the blanks draw engagement because they set up the reader with most of the answer – all they have to do is input their own thought at the end.

Examples:

Fill in the blank: My biggest social media marketing headache is _ If I had an unlimited social media budget I would spend it on _
Now you take the answers to inspire future content ideas and even courses!

Caption This
Ask your followers to get a little creative and caption images, videos or .GIFs. Simply post your content with the caption “Caption This” and see what responses you get.
Ask For Opinions
Simply ask your followers for their opinions on a (brand related) trending topic, an article you’re sharing, news within your industry etc.
Polls
Polls are a fun way to gather opinions on a subject and get your audience to interact with you. They can be a great content mix up/engagement generator. Ask a question that’s related to both your field and your follower’s interests.
For example beforehand deciding which format your next course should be, you can ask your audience this question “What’s your favourite way to learn?” with choices for audio, text, and video. It’s an easy question anyone can answer.

That’s a basic example, but your polls can get pretty detailed and offer you insight into your audience’s behaviors and preferences – which you can then use to develop better content or even courses.

You can create polls related to popular conversations, events, or other moments – remember to use the hashtag within your question for added visibility.

A vs. B
Keep it simple and let your audience choose between two options. If you cannot decide between two course cover designs or e-book covers, you can simply post the images and get your audience to aid the decision.
Questions
Asking questions is probably one of the easiest ways to get your audience interacting with you on social media – and another great way to “pick their brains”.
Here are a few different types of questions you can ask. Post these as text, or add an image/video for more visibility.

Open ended questions are great for driving social media engagement because they open the floor for thought sharing and conversation. e.g. “Team A battles Team B on Wednesday! Where will you be watching the game?”
“Yes” or “No” questions are simple to answer and can be a good starting point to work your audience up to answering more open ended questions or discussions.

Host Live Videos
Live videos can rack up a lot of reach and social media engagement. Try them on Facebook or Instagram. Collaborate with influencers to host a Q & A, mini training or just chat (and ask them to invite their audience). Let the audience submit questions in advance and take a few live ones as well.
Bonus
My bonus tip for driving social media engagement and interaction is to use call to action when you want your audience to do something. Yes, it can be that simple.

Using call to action as simple as “share this post”, “leave a comment”, or “click this link” increases the chances of your audience taking the action you want. Just remember to keep these to a minimum as you don’t want your audience to get tired of you telling them what to do.

I hope this post helps you get creative and create posts that drive social media engagement for your brand or business. Remember that you may not get a response the first time, or the second, or the third – but keep trying.

P. S: Watch out for our BIG announcement this month.

Talk soon,
