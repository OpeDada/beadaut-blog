How do you capture your audience’s attention in a world where the average human’s attention span is less than that of a fish?

7 seconds!

That’s all you got to grab people’s attention or lose it to their ever wondering eyes or is it minds. 😂

Whichever it is, you get the point, right? 👍🏼

If you have ever tried to promote your course on social media, then you know how tough it is to get people to take a look at what you’re offering.

While you can try your best to do everything, sometimes it helps to focus on one aspect of digital marketing and really give it your attention. It might seem daunting to do so, but if you want quality leads that help your business grow, then it might be worth investing some time.

The best way to do this is to use a very good lead magnet.

What exactly is a lead magnet?

It is an incentive you offer to people in exchange for their e-mail addresses. You provide valuable and useful content that your audience finds so irresistible that they just have to get it.

Why do you need their email address? Email marketing, of course!

Lead magnets are designed to be a give-and-take, which is why it’s crucial to design something that actually provides a user with something valuable they would not find elsewhere. The give and take nature of using a lead magnet establishes a relationship from the get-go.

Also, rather than spending time nurturing leads that might not be as relevant, the lead magnet identifies which users are truly interested in your courses or coaching. They would not have accepted your offer if it didn’t apply to them. The content of the lead magnet becomes the jumping-off point from which you then have a chance to continue nurturing the lead.

So, you see why you definitely need to use Lead Magnets in promoting your offers online and even offline? Now, if you’re not sure how to choose the right lead magnet, then you cannot afford to miss next week’s article because we’ll be talking about how to choose the right lead magnet for your offer.

If you have not yet whitelisted this email address, you should do that now, so you don’t miss any other emails from me.

Have a lovely weekend.

Talk Soon,
