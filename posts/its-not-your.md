Designing a new course, especially as a beginner is a fun, exciting, and transformative experience. It’s an opportunity to dig deep and tap into the well of resources, knowledge and experiences that have been crying for expression within you. It’s also a chance for you to find your teaching voice and begin the journey of life transformation.

Why is it that you struggle to get a project done while there’s ample time but find yourself pouring with ideas and having a million and one things to do just before the deadline? Team projects are notorious for taking far more time than expected, which means you don’t have to go far to find some famous examples.

Apple pushed off the launch of their HomePod because they needed “a little more time” to refine it. Windows continuously delayed an anticipated feature for Windows 10, before quietly axing it altogether. Even construction of the Sydney Opera House was only supposed to take four years. It ended up taking 14.

Both personal projects and teamwork suffer this same phenomenon.

But why does this happen? Why does team productivity and personal productivity (and by extension, your schedule) run off the rails? Parkinson’s Law has a lot to do with it.

What is Parkinson’s Law?

Parkinson’s Law is the adage that work expands to fill the time allotted to it. Put simply, the amount of work required adjusts to the time available for its completion. The term was first coined by Cyril Northcote Parkinson in a humorous essay he wrote for the Economist in 1955.

Now you see why it isn’t your fault. Parkinson’s Law is responsible for the near deadline rush you experience with tasks and projects.

Procrastination is a key player in Parkinson’s Law. Knowing that we have a set amount of time to do something often inspires us to leave work to the very last minute – and our delays in getting started mean the time required for that task expands.

How do you now make it stop or reduce the rush drastically?

The answer is simple…

Use the law to your advantage.

This isn’t something that just happens, it’s a result of careful deliberate planning. The first thing you want to do is to start early, no matter how much time you think you have.

Next, answer these questions, then do the suggested activity:

1. What does completing this project/task mean to you?

2. How will it change your life?

3. What will you have access to or stop doing once the project is done?

4. Now imagine that the project is completed. What feelings come to your mind? Hold that good feeling in mind. Don’t you want to make it permanent?

What will your life be like if you are unable to complete the task/project?

Write your answers to these questions in your journal and copy them in small notes then paste this note in places where you can easily see it throughout the day. Each time you feel yourself dragging or giving excuses for not working on your project, remind yourself of that good feeling and reward that await you.
