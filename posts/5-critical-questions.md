Designing a new course, especially as a beginner is a fun, exciting, and transformative experience. It’s an opportunity to dig deep and tap into the well of resources, knowledge and experiences that have been crying for expression within you. It’s also a chance for you to find your teaching voice and begin the journey of life transformation.

However, before you actually roll up your sleeves and get started, there’s a lot of self-discovery that you need to do. The more clarity you have before getting started, the better you can help your students and deliver life-changing results.

POWER TIP

Don’t create a course until you have a clear picture of the results your students will get after taking it.

To help you on your path, here are 5 questions you should ask yourself before creating a new course.

Who is your target audience?
What’s their biggest challenge right now?
What courses are your competition offering?
How do you attract the right people?
How do you measure students’ performance?
Did anything jump out at you as you read those questions? Answering them should be at the core of your process before thinking about creating a course.

Remember to have fun while answering those questions. There’s no right or wrong answer, only respond honestly.
